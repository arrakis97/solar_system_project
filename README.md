# Solar System Project
This is one of the projects I did in my astronomy bachelor. It is the animation of our Solar System and uses the Runge-Kutta method.
It contains some plots showing kinetic, potential and total energy for all planets. It also shows how the velocity changes with respect to distance from the Sun.
